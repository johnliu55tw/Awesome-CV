Being a software engineer with an M.S. degree in mechanical engineering makes me see things differently. Being a Linux and Vim enthusiast for 5+ years, I am familiar with all sort of administration and development tools and techniques on Linux. Huge believer of \textit{KISS} and \textit{CLEAN} principles, and believes that codes will only work if they have been tested. Loves to dive into challenging problems and find out the root cause, and willing to study and learn new technologies or skills if they could help.
